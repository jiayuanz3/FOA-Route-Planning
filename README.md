# FOA-Grid-based Route Planning

This is a piece work from COMP10002 Foundation of Algorithmn Project 2(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 10/2019.

In this project, I leant about route planning, and implemented a simple route re-planning mechanism. Route planning is used in the navigation of autonomous agents, e.g., self-driving vehicles, robots, and humans (think of mapping services). Grid-based route planning studies the problem of constructing a route from an initial cell to a destination cell in a two-dimensional space subdivided into grid cells that are either blocked or empty. 

code.c is the code file, others are test cases.
